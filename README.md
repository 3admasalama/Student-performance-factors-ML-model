# 🎓 Student Performance Prediction

This project was developed during my **Elevvo Pathways Internship – Machine Learning Track**.  
It explores the factors influencing student academic outcomes using data analysis and machine learning.  
It also represents my **first end-to-end ML project**.

---

## 📊 Project Overview
The dataset contains various features such as:
- Hours studied  
- Attendance  
- Parental involvement  
- Access to resources  
- Extracurricular activities  
- Teacher quality  

The goal is to analyze these factors and predict student performance outcomes.

## 🛠️ Features
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding, scaling.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Correlation heatmaps, feature distributions, and insights.  
- **Machine Learning Models**: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest.  
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix.  
- **Feature Importance**: Identifying which factors impact performance most.

## 🚀 Results
- Built baseline and advanced ML models.  
- Achieved strong predictive performance (Random Forest performed best).  
- Found study hours, attendance, and teacher quality to be key predictors.
